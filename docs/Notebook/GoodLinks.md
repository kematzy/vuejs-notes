## [FIRESTORE: Enable Offline Data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/enable-offline)

  Cloud Firestore supports offline data persistence. This feature caches a copy of the Cloud Firestore data that your app is actively using, so your app can access the data when the device is offline. You can write, read, listen to, and query the cached data. When the device comes back online, Cloud Firestore synchronizes any local changes made by your app to the data stored remotely in Cloud Firestore.

  by Jeff Delaney

## [CASL](https://stalniy.github.io/casl/)

  CASL (pronounced /ˈkæsəl/, like castle) is an isomorphic authorization JavaScript library which restricts what resources a given user is allowed to access. All permissions are defined in a single location (the Ability class) and not duplicated across UI components, API services, and database queries.
  
  Heavily inspired by cancan.
